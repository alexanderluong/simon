Challenges and solutions:
1.) I initially was confused about what the objective even was for the Easy Task. 
  --> I took a more thorough look at the README.md in order to grasp the task. 

Thoughts:
1.) For the easy task, since I want to disable the other noteboxes while one is playing, I'm thinking about using an array. For every notebox that's pressed, I'll add it to the end of the array. The array will be reading the first notebox. If there's no note currently playing, I'll play the note and shift the array.
2.) I wasn't sure what the units of NOTE_DURATION were in. After a quick google search, it's in milliseconds. I'm going to set the timeout to 2500 for the requirements of the easy task.
